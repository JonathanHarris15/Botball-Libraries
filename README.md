# Botball-Library
The Code here is written by the Plainview Robotics Team for the botball robotics competition. The main brach of this repository is up to date with the latest code and the branches are just old code from previous years. pulling directly from a past branch is not recomended but most of the functions are somewhat stable and can be used with minor tweaking.
